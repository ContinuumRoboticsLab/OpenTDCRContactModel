# OpenTDCRContactModel

This is an open-source implementation of a 2D kinematic model of a single segment TDCR. 


Current model implementations are based on Ashwin et al.'s work [1]. 

Additional details on the backbone representation and optimisation setup can be found in [2]. The model available in this repo has been used to simulate the robot interacting with the environment, and consequently generate motion plans for contact-aided navigation.
